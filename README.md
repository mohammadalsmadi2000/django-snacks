# Django Intro Lab

This repository contains the code for a small, functional multi-page website built using Django. The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to the Django framework and demonstrate the benefits of using a mature and robust framework for web development. In addition, you will learn how to style your site using the utility-first framework, TailwindCSS.
